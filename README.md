This project's aim was to establish systems for building an AI training dataset for detecting local isolated black holes on nightsky images to be obtained from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory telescope. The project consisted of three primary components: applying the black hole microlensing algorithm to images (accomplished by Raymond Shao), denoising telescope images that will come from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (Yunki Yau), and dynamically applying the microlensing algorithm to modelled black hole distances, masses and velocities on telescope images (Jaime Pryor).
